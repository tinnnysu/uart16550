2.05.2001
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed transmitter and receiver - the start and the stop bits were sent and received complemented.
  Big thanks go to Bob Kirstein for pointing this out to me.


31.05.2001
~~~~~~~~~~

* Minor changes in register reading code
* Changed FCR to be 2 bits wide (reset bits are not needed) and instead enabled the rx_reset and tx_reset
   signals which I forgot to implement.
* Changed defines for FCR.
* Cleaned ports that were not connected in top-level.
* Changed the code to have only one FIFO module instead of two to overcome versioning problem on the cost of
   some additional gate count. UART_RX_FIFO was modified a little and renamed to UART_FIFO.
* UART_RX_FIFO.v and UART_TX_FIFO.v files removed from the project.
* Changes to receiver and transmitter modules concerning FIFO handling.
* Commented out `include "UART_defines" in all files but UART_top.v and test bench.
* Modified test bench a little for a little better check.


29.05.2001
~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed: Line Control Register block didn't have wb_rst_i in its sensitivity list
* Fixed: Modem Status Register block didn't have wb_rst_i in its sensitivity list and didn't set reset value
* Fixed rf_pop, lsr_mask, msi_reset and threi_clear not being synthesizable in release 1.7. (Thanks 
	to Pavel Korenski for pointing this to me)


27.05.2001
~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to Rick Wright for pointing me many of my bugs.

* Fixed the rf_pop and lsr_mask flags not being deasserted.
* Fixed Time-Out interrupt not being masked by bit 0 in IER
* Fixed interrupt logic not being masked by IER
* Fixed bit 0 (interrupt pending) of IIR being set incorrectly
* Fixed Modem Status Register bits 3:0 handling (didn't work as should have)
* Fixed modem status interrupt to be related to bits [3:0] (deltas) instead of the bits 7:4 of MSR.
   This way the interrupt is cleared upon reading from the MSR.
* Fixed THRE interrupt not being reset by reading IIR
* Changed Receiver and Transmitter FIFO, so that they do not use the FIFO_inc.v file because of problems
  with #include command.
* Removed FIFO_inc.v from CVS tree.

* Updated specifications .pdf file
