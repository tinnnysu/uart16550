~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed the rf_pop and lsr_mask flags not being deasserted.
* Fixed Time-Out interrupt not being masked by bit 0 in IER
* Fixed interrupt logic not being masked by IER
* Fixed bit 0 (interrupt pending) of IIR being set incorrectly
* Fixed Modem Status Register bits 3:0 handling (didn't work as should have)
* Fixed modem status interrupt to be related to bits [3:0] (deltas) instead of the bits 7:4 of MSR.
   This way the interrupt is cleared upon reading from the MSR.
* Fixed THRE interrupt not being reset by reading IIR
* Changed Receiver and Transmitter FIFO, so that they do not use the FIFO_inc.v file because of problems
  with #include command.
* Removed FIFO_inc.v from CVS tree.

* Updated specifications .pdf file
