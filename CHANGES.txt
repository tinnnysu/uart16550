27.05.2001 (release 1.7)
~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to Rick Wright for pointing me many of my bugs.

* Fixed the rf_pop and lsr_mask flags not being deasserted.
* Fixed Time-Out interrupt not being masked by bit 0 in IER
* Fixed interrupt logic not being masked by IER
* Fixed bit 0 (interrupt pending) of IIR being set incorrectly
* Fixed Modem Status Register bits 3:0 handling (didn't work as should have)
* Fixed modem status interrupt to be related to bits [3:0] (deltas) instead of the bits 7:4 of MSR.
   This way the interrupt is cleared upon reading from the MSR.
* Fixed THRE interrupt not being reset by reading IIR
* Changed Receiver and Transmitter FIFO, so that they do not use the FIFO_inc.v file because of problems
  with #include command.
* Removed FIFO_inc.v from CVS tree.

* Updated specifications .pdf file

29.05.2001 (release 1.8)

* Fixed: Modem Status Register block didn't have wb_rst_i in its sensitivity list and didn't set reset value
* Fixed rf_pop, lsr_mask, msi_reset and threi_clear not being synthesizable in release 1.7. (Thanks 
	to Pavel Korenski for pointing this to me)
